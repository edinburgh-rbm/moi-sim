* Stormtest.scala

  - The slices method is neat and breaks up values of the form (t, dt,
    v) according to the least common time segments. But this means
    that it copies around v a lot, referenced potentially by lots of
    new slices. Is it passed by reference or by value? Test.

  - What on earth does   "ChangeHelper" should "Integrate changes
    correctly" mean???? The test does some operations with
    intersectAndStore but the assert statements that are commented out
    are nonsense and I have no idea if the console prints say anything
    useful.
