Notes on running the simulations as of 2014-06-11. This is done as in
the README with 

  sbt
  > project MOISModels
  > run

Annoyingly when there is an error, sbt just seems to hang and needs to
be killed with ^C. This could possibly be fixed with the -batch
command line parameter to sbt.

Many of the simulations rely on gnuplot, though this is documented in
README.md it is not documented that running the simulations implies
plotting the output!

There may be a version mismatch with gnuplot, or the generated .plt
file is often invalid. For example:

    plot 'gnuplot_74058156.gp' using 1:2 title 'p'  with lines pt 7 ps
    0.8, 'gnuplot_74058156.gp' using 1:3 title 'c'  with lines pt 7 ps
    0.8, 'gnuplot_74058156.gp' using 1:4 title 'r'  with lines pt 7 ps
    0.8, 'gnuplot_74058156.gp' using 1:5 title 'a'  with lines pt 7 ps
    0.8, 'gnuplot_74058156.gp' using 1:6 title 'g'  with lines pt 7 ps 0.8
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ^
    "gnuplot_77950336.gp", line 8: warning: No pointtype specifier
    allowed, here

Furthermore the exit status of gnuplot appears to not be checked so
the error ends up on stderr but the interpreter thinks that the
operation has succeeded.
